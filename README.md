## On-chain dumb tetris 
1. Users can mint blank image as NFT (8x8 pixel)
2. The moment they transfer is, there will be a tetris block created from a random shape. 
3. Once the first shape reaches in the bottom, a new shape will be added on next transaction
4. This all will happen on-chain and stored on-chain
5. This project is based on on-chain generative transfer art
